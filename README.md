# immich-pet-tagger

Automatic pet tagging for Immich. Identifies your pets in new photos and tags them as people in Immich, the same way Immich tags human faces, but for cats, dogs, or any visually distinct subject.

Uses CLIP embeddings and a few reference photos you provide. No cloud services, no training required, runs entirely on your own hardware as a Docker sidecar alongside Immich.

## How it works

1. You enroll your pets via a web UI: provide a few reference photos and a short description
2. A logistic regression classifier is trained locally on CLIP embeddings of those references
3. Every 5 minutes, new photos are classified and matching pets are tagged in Immich
4. Pets appear in Immich's People section just like humans

## Features

- **Import from Immich**: if Immich already recognizes your pet as a person, import them in one click. The tool picks up to 20 evenly distributed reference photos automatically.
- **Find similar photos**: two-stage search — Immich's CLIP text search narrows the field, then the local classifier ranks by pet probability. Instant when the pet has no refs yet.
- **Find candidates for "not my pets"**: searches across all pets at once, scores results by pet-likeness, and surfaces the top 60 most confusable photos for bulk review.
- **Negative samples**: mark photos that look like your pet but aren't, to sharpen the classifier's ability to reject false positives.
- **Tagged photos panel**: review all photos currently tagged for a pet in Immich; remove tags or mark as "not my pets" in bulk.
- **Date ranges**: restrict a pet to photos taken within a specific period (useful for pets that have passed away or were adopted later).
- **Scan controls**: set the scan start date and trigger a scan from the sidebar; the last scan stats are shown live.

## Requirements

- Immich running via Docker Compose (tested with v2.7.5)
- Docker on the same host
- An Immich API key with the following permissions:

  | Permission | Reason |
  |---|---|
  | `asset.read` | Search results and asset metadata |
  | `asset.view` | Loading thumbnails |
  | `person.create` | Creating a new pet as a person in Immich |
  | `person.read` | Reading existing persons and thumbnails |
  | `person.update` | Renaming a pet |
  | `person.delete` | Deleting a pet |
  | `person.reassign` | Assigning a face to a person |
  | `face.create` | Writing face entries (the actual tagging) |
  | `face.read` | Checking existing faces on an asset |
  | `face.delete` | Removing face entries on ref removal or pet deletion |

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tedornitier/immich-pet-tagger
cd immich-pet-tagger
```

### 2. Find your Immich Docker network

```bash
docker network ls
```

Look for a network with "immich" in the name (e.g. `immich_default`).

### 3. Configure docker-compose.yml

Edit the following values:

```yaml
environment:
  - IMMICH_URL=http://immich-server:2283     # how this container reaches Immich (container-to-container)
  - IMMICH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here         # generate one in Immich: Account Settings → API Keys
  - IMMICH_EXTERNAL_URL=http://localhost:2283 # how your browser reaches Immich (for photo links)

networks:
  immich_default:          # match your actual network name from step 2
    external: true
```

### 4. Start the container

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f   # watch startup logs
```

On first build, the YOLO model (~6 MB) is downloaded and baked into the image. On first start, the CLIP model (~350 MB) is downloaded and cached inside the container. Subsequent starts are fast.

### 5. Open the UI

Go to **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

## Getting started

Getting good results takes a few iterations. The typical flow is: add a pet, build up references, add some negatives, run a short test scan, review the results, refine, and repeat until you're satisfied — then run the full backfill.

### Step 1: Add your pet

**Import from Immich** — if Immich already recognizes your pet as a person from its own face detection:

1. Click **↓ Import from Immich** in the sidebar
2. Find and click your pet in the grid
3. Enter a short description (e.g. `orange tabby cat`) and an optional date range
4. Click **Import** — up to 20 reference photos are imported automatically

**Add manually** — if Immich doesn't know your pet yet:

1. Click **+ Add pet**, fill in the name, a short description (e.g. `black labrador dog`), and an optional date range
2. Click **Create**

The description is used by Immich's CLIP model to find the first batch of candidate photos. Keep it short: 2–4 descriptive keywords.

### Step 2: Add reference photos

References are what the classifier learns from. Quality matters more than quantity.

1. Select your pet in the sidebar and click **Find references**
2. Browse the results — they are ranked by visual similarity to your description or existing refs
3. Select clear, varied photos and click **Add to pet →**
4. Aim for 10–20 references to start; you can always add more

What to avoid:
- **Multiple animals in frame** — YOLO crops to one animal and you can't control which, so the embedding may be for the wrong pet
- **Blurry or dark shots** — CLIP embeddings are less reliable when the subject isn't clearly visible
- **Uncertain ones** — if you're not sure it's your pet, skip it; noise in refs hurts more than a smaller count

### Step 3: Add "not my pets" samples

These help the classifier reject photos that look similar to your pet but aren't, reducing false positives.

1. In the **Not my pets** panel (bottom right of the screen), click **Find candidates**
2. The tool scans your library and surfaces the most confusable photos — animals that score high but aren't yours
3. Select photos that are not your pet and click **Not my pets**
4. Aim for roughly 2–3× as many negatives as total references across all pets

### Step 4: Run a test scan

Start with a recent date to keep scans short and fast during iteration — the fewer photos, the quicker you can review and refine.

1. In the **Scan from** panel at the bottom of the sidebar, set a date 1–2 weeks back
2. Click **Scan** and wait for the results
3. If **Review N low confidence** appears in the results, click it — these are borderline cases the classifier wasn't sure about
4. Go through them: add correctly identified ones as references, mark wrong ones as **Not my pets**, and skip the rest

### Step 5: Iterate

Repeat steps 2–4 a couple of times. Each round of added references and negatives improves accuracy. Results typically stabilize after 2–3 iterations.

### Step 6: Run the full backfill

Once you're happy with the accuracy on the test window:

1. Set the scan date to the earliest date you want to tag — for example, the date you got your pet
2. Click **Scan** to process all photos in that range

After that, the background poller runs every 5 minutes and tags new photos automatically. Your pets appear in Immich's **People** section.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IMMICH_URL` | `http://immich-server:2283` | Immich URL for container-to-container communication |
| `IMMICH_EXTERNAL_URL` | `http://localhost:2283` | Immich URL as seen from your browser, used for links |
| `IMMICH_API_KEY` | required | Immich API key |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | `300` | Seconds between scans |
| `SCAN_WORKERS` | `GPU_WORKERS × 32` | Concurrent thumbnail fetches. Auto-derived to keep GPU batches full. Override only if Immich feels slow during scans. |
| `GPU_WORKERS` | `2` | Parallel YOLO and CLIP inference threads. `2` is optimal for most GPUs; more threads shrink batch sizes and hurt throughput. |
| `THRESHOLD` | `0.8` | Min confidence (0–1) to tag a photo |

## GPU support

All three configurations run the same code. GPU is faster but not required.

**NVIDIA (default)**
Requires the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html). Keep the default `docker-compose.yml` as-is.

**AMD (ROCm)**
Requires ROCm drivers on the host. In `docker-compose.yml`:
- Change `CUDA: "true"` to `ROCM: "true"` under `build.args`
- Change `driver: nvidia` to `driver: amdgpu` under `deploy`
- Rebuild: `docker compose build`

**CPU-only (no GPU)**
Works out of the box, just slower (~10x). In `docker-compose.yml`:
- Remove or comment out the `CUDA: "true"` build arg
- Remove the entire `deploy` section
- `SCAN_WORKERS` auto-adjusts to 8 (no need to set it manually)
- Rebuild: `docker compose build`

## Limitations

- **YOLO fallback**: when no animals are detected by YOLO, the full image is classified as a whole and only one pet can be tagged per photo
- **Polling only**: photos are processed within 5 minutes of upload, not instantly

## Troubleshooting

**Pet not appearing in Immich after enrollment**
Immich only shows people with at least one face assigned. Add at least one reference photo and wait for a poll cycle.

**Low accuracy / wrong pet tagged**
Add more reference photos, add more negative samples, or lower the threshold in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Container can't reach Immich**
Make sure the network name in `docker-compose.yml` matches the output of `docker network ls`.

**Thumbnail proxy returns 401**
Your API key is missing `asset.view` permission.
